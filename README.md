# LeetCode Quest: Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of solutions for the "LeetCode Quest: Data Structures and Algorithms" with pattern identification and personal learning notes.

## My Approach

**For problems I solved independently:**
- Solve without any help and get it accepted on LeetCode
- Use Claude to identify improvements and patterns
- Document the problem with useful insights

**For problems that required guidance:**
- Use Claude for high-level logic guidance only
- Implement my own solution based on that logic
- Document the approach and patterns learned

## Notes

- All solutions are written in **Go**
- These are **my solutions**, they work and I understand them, but may not be the most optimal
- This repository is primarily for tracking my own progress and learning
- Each problem includes pattern identification for future reference
